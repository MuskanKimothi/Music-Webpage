        <h4>"The best, most beautiful, and most perfect way that we have of expressing
           a sweet concord of mind to each other is by music."</h4>
          <p class="author">-Jonathan Edwards</p>
          <p>Music is a part of every known society, past and present, and is common to all human cultures across the globe.

The emotions caused by music, the attitudes of its composers and players, and the venues it is played can also vary from time to time and place to place. The music one person loves might be painful for another to listen to, and vice versa!
quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one’s neighbor — such is my idea of happiness.</p>
